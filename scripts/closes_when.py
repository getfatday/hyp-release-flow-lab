"""closes_when.py -- shared closes-when predicate parser + evaluator.

Design: experiments/runs/H-100/fixture/prevention-design.md (S2, "the closes-when
convention"). Spec: hypotheses/H-100-commitment-detector.md. This module is shared by
commitment_lint.py (the sweep) and, later, the H-101 ledger resolver: one predicate
evaluator, two consumers, so the sweep and the ledger can never disagree on open/closed
(the split-brain guard, design S4.2).

Grammar (at most one bracket per line, appended to the committing line):

    [closes-when: <predicate>=<argument>]

parsed by:

    \\[closes-when:\\s*(path-exists|commit-grep|hypothesis-kept|maintainer-ruling|decision-resolved)=([^\\]]+)\\]

Unknown predicate or empty argument = malformed. The design treats "malformed" and
"bracket absent" identically -- both are "no valid closes-when" -- so parse_bracket()
returns None for both.

All five predicates are evaluated read-only, against committed (HEAD) state ONLY, never
the working tree: "committed at HEAD" (path-exists), "some commit message" (commit-grep),
"landed as kept ... at HEAD" (hypothesis-kept), "some committed filename" (maintainer-
ruling), "an accepted|denied decision-resolution row in the ledger at HEAD"
(decision-resolved, decisions-schema.md section 4) -- the Durability invariant
("uncommitted work effectively does not exist").

Stdlib + git only. No network. No writes.
