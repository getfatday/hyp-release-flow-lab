"""dispatch-status.py -- the ranked next-item dispatch surface (see docs/workgraph.md).

Ported for hyp 0.2.0 from the source lab's live install `scripts/wave-status.py
--dispatch` (the joined landing of three counted keeps: H-213 stop-driver-unattended,
kept 2x5/5 2026-08-29; H-215 claim-join-two-writers, kept 2x5/5 2026-08-29; H-217
reboot-relaunch, kept 2x5/5 2026-08-29). The join logic, close rule, liveness law, and
output schema are the lab install's; the ONE consumer adaptation is the eligible-item
source: the lab enumerates its release-train wave plan (lab-only infrastructure), this
port enumerates the consumer's own hypotheses corpus -- every registered spec whose
COMMITTED line-initial `## Status` word is not yet terminal (kept/discarded; refine
reruns). Paths resolve through `.claude/hyp.json` (hypotheses_dir, runs_dir).

The close rule (H-213, verbatim in effect): an item is OPEN until its committed exit
artifact is visible at the requested commit (HEAD by default) -- here the line-initial
spec Status verdict. Detection is COMMITTED-only: the working tree never counts, so no
promise string or uncommitted edit can close an item. This empty-dispatch artifact check
is the shared exit condition for every driver layer (the Stop dispatcher, detached
chains, cold-start re-readers, scheduled resume firings).

The dispatch list is CLAIM-JOINED (H-215): each open item's live claim surface --
<runs_dir>/<id>/LANE-STATE.json, the H-216 liveness contract (heartbeat_unix age against
ttl_s; ttl_s = 1800 pinned by the lab's constants ruling; committed schema fields, never
file mtime, never a process table) -- filters every open item whose claim heartbeat is
fresher than the TTL: fresh-claimed items are skipped (reported under claimed_fresh,
never dispatched), stale-claimed items surface again as actionable, so concurrent
readers are steered to disjoint unclaimed items at the list, not the lock. A claim can
only defer an item within its TTL, never close it (--at replays the exit check only).
Refusal-then-re-dispatch rule (binding, every driver layer): if your claim is refused
with the typed exit 3 (scripts/lane-takeover.py -- the lane is fresh-claimed by another
executor), re-run this dispatch -- the freshly claimed item is now filtered out -- and
claim the NEW top item instead.

The dispatch list is also ORPHAN-JOINED (H-217): for every open item whose LANE-STATE
says state=running, the LIVE PID TABLE on THIS host is probed. A lane whose recorded pid
is DEAD on this host is an ORPHAN -- the post-reboot class -- and stays ACTIONABLE with
a recovery verb: `land-terminal` when the newest chain-terminal.run* holds a nonzero rc
(the chain died before landing), else `relaunch`. The orphan join is TTL-FREE -- a dead
pid trumps a fresh heartbeat -- and pid-local: foreign-host or pid-less running lanes
are never orphaned from here (they fall through to the heartbeat join). A running lane
whose pid is ALIVE with a fresh heartbeat is LIVE and is never dispatched. Detection
here is pid-based and immediate, but ADOPTION still goes through the claim door
(scripts/lane-takeover.py), which grants only on heartbeat expiry.

REFILL (0.3.0; ported from the source lab's throughput-floor patch to wave-status.py,
2026-09-02): "N open" can be a starved frontier -- an open item whose committed
`## Status` BLOCK carries a PARKED / BLOCKED-* / COUNTING marker (the markers live in
the status comment, invisible to the line-initial status word) is open but not
actionable. When fewer than 2 open items are actionable (orphans always count
actionable -- they carry recovery verbs), the dispatch appends a REFILL section
listing the licensed follow-up lanes of the consumer's FOLLOWUPS surface
(`followups_file` in .claude/hyp.json, default hypotheses/FOLLOWUPS.md; grammar in
docs/workgraph.md). Followups are read from the LIVE working tree like the claim join:
they are advisory refill surface, never exit artifacts. REFILL is uncounted
build/register dispatch only -- it never reorders counted runs and never closes an
item. Consumer adaptation from the lab patch: the lab also refills from its release
train's next queued wave; a consumer corpus is flat, so the FOLLOWUPS surface is the
whole refill source.

Usage (repo root: --root, then CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, then cwd):
    python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dispatch-status.py" [--json] [--at <sha>]

Exit 0 with the dispatch (text or --json); exit 3 when the root has no commits.
Read-only over the repo; stdlib only.
