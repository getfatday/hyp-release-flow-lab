"""rule-lint.py -- H-248 four-class rule-currency lint (the lane's deliverable).

Deterministic, offline, advisory. Reads ONLY corpus files under the corpus
root passed as argv[1]; never the repo, never a clock, never the network.

Corpus contract (the registry-schema lane's corpus shape, H-248 Method,
frozen at registration):
  as-of-date.txt            pinned ISO date; "past" means < this date
  rules-registry.jsonl      one typed row per rule:
                            kind,id,text,carriers,licensed_by,scope_licensed,
                            scope_written,class(permanent|empirical),
                            cost_class,retest_by,retest_method,status
                            (permanent rows carry exemption_reason, no
                            retest_by)
  retest-intents.jsonl      rows {kind:"retest-intent",rule_id,status,...};
                            an OPEN intent suppresses RULE-EXPIRED (the
                            retest is already in flight)
  re-earn-evidence.jsonl    rows {kind:"re-earn",rule_id,evidence,...}; a
                            re-earn row suppresses SCOPE-EXCESS
  carriers/**               compiled rule carriers; clauses live between
                            RULES-BEGIN / RULES-END marker lines, one clause
                            per line, each tagged [R-NNN] with its registry
                            row id
  pinned-tree/**            committed-artifact stand-ins the licensed_by
                            pointers must resolve into

The four detection contracts (spec Method, frozen):
  RULE-EXPIRED    class==empirical AND (retest_by missing/null OR
                  retest_by < as-of) AND no open retest intent row.
                  Permanent-class rows NEVER fire this class.
  RULE-UNLICENSED licensed_by empty, or NO entry resolves to a committed
                  artifact in the pinned tree (an entry with a #Lnn anchor
                  must hit an existing line that is not question-classified,
                  i.e. does not end with "?").
  RULE-ORPHAN     a carrier clause line with no registry row: untagged, or
                  tagged with an id absent from the registry.
  SCOPE-EXCESS    scope_written.breadth strictly broader than
                  scope_licensed.breadth (instance < class < universal) with
                  no re-earn evidence row for the rule.

Output grammar (frozen): one finding per line,
  CLASS<TAB>ID<TAB>CARRIER-PATH<TAB>REFERENT
commentary lines start with "# "; findings sorted by (class,id,carrier,
referent); NO absolute paths, NO timestamps; exit 0 ALWAYS (advisory
contract -- assertion 4).

Landed from the KEPT reference implementation (H-248 rule-expiry-lint, 2x5/5
2026-09-02) experiments/runs/H-248/fixture/rule-lint.py — the four detection
contracts unchanged. One adaptation at land time: resolve_license understands
the canonical registry's licensed_by grammar (H-247 schema): a "path:" prefix
resolves under the pinned tree, and "commit:<sha>" entries are non-resolving
here (offline lint; compile-laws.py lint-registry checks them at the pin — a
row passes when any path: entry resolves). Live corpus root is assembled by
scripts/harden-check.sh ADVISORY-28 (as-of-date + registry + pinned-tree link);
RULE-EXPIRED findings feed the rule-retest decision flow (H-249,
decisions.py --class rule-retest).
